# Welcome 👋

This is a wishlist for technical articles. If you have a question that needs a longer explanation or a topic that interests you in the realm of **3D, UI, or Multiuser**, [create an issue](https://github.com/bbohlender/article-wishlist/issues/new) that describes what the article should be about.

## Support ❤️

If this wishlist contains an article you would love to read, you can fund the article via [polar](https://polar.sh/bbohlender/issues) ❤️.

Funding articles and supporting my work will allow me to continue creating Open-Source libraries and sharing my knowledge along the way.

> [!TIP]
> Everybody funding an article will appear at the top of the article if they want.
